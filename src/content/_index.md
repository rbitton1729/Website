# I am Raphael

I'm an undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying Data Science and Music.

I'm a Linux enthusiast (some call me an absolutist). Everything I own runs Linux, and nothing excites me more than an hours-long terminal session.

I'm a world traveler — see my flight log and select photos in the menu above.

I'm an amateur composer; I’m working on a way to host my music and scores here.
