### Student, System Orchestrator (and Occasional Composer), Explorer

Welcome to my home. Please take off your shoes before entering—or don't; I'm not checking.

University of Chicago President's Scholar with an obsession for **Linux** and systems orchestration. I've ditched all my Apple and Windows devices to go all-in on self-hosting—spending late nights (often at 4 a.m.) building Docker Compose stacks and maintaining a constellation of services across servers nationwide. When I'm not configuring systems, you might find me in a flight simulator cockpit perfecting ILS approaches, or reflecting on having visited 24 countries across six continents in 2023 alone.

You can use the menu above to find where you'd like to go—or just stare at my headshot for a while. Either is fine.
