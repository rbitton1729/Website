## Prerequisites

**Hardware:**
- A spare computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Minimum 4GB RAM, 20GB free storage
- Stable internet connection

**Software:**
- Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15 or newer, or Linux kernel 5.10+
- Basic command line familiarity

**Accounts & Domain:**
- Free Cloudflare account
- A domain name (you can get one free from Freenom, or purchase from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc., though I reccomend just buying one from Cloudflare to simplify the process since they sell them at-cost)

**Skill Level:** Beginner to intermediate - I'll explain each step as we go.
