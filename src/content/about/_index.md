# Who is Raphael?

A fair question. I’m still figuring that out myself, but here's what I know thus far.

I’m a 4th year student at the University of Chicago with an enduring fascination for systems — the kind that hum quietly when they work and demand humility when they don’t. Most of my time goes into running and refining a constellation of Linux machines, tinkering with infrastructure, and turning half-baked technical curiosities into functioning projects.

My formal majors are Data Science and Music, but I'm kind of all over the place. I do systems research in the C.S. department and spend most of my time tinkering.

I like systems that make sense, music that doesn’t, and the way both Adele and Bach can bring order to chaos. Whether I’m balancing RAID arrays, planning the next server migration, or diving into aviation data for no practical reason, I’m driven by the same thing: curiosity, and the satisfaction of making something truly work.

I'm a dual Canadian-American citizen born and raised in Long Beach, California and currently residing in Chicago.
