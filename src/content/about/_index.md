# Who is Raphael?

A fair question. I’m still figuring that out myself. Buckle up, because you’re going to pretend you’re me while I narrate. If that’s not your jam, that’s okay; I’m just trying something and running with it. You (may or may not) have free will, so feel free to click away, but I promise this is a great way to get to know me.

Saturday, April 12th, 2003. Long Beach, California. It’s a cool, rainy day with a high dew point (maybe—I’m just making that up). A few minutes after noon, you spawn into the world. Excited and curious, you first meet your mom and dad, who will love and support you for the next two and a half decades. Your parents are Israeli by birth, naturalized in Canada, and your mother in the U.S. Your mom is a clinical neuropsychologist (we can call her Dr. Mom), and your dad is an “inventor,” though a lawyer by training.

Okay, this is starting to read like an edgy college admissions paper—but I promise mine were much drier and less interesting than this. Anyway, skip forward a few years, and you’re in high school. You don’t have much of a personality right now, and you’re looking for a way to define yourself, so you end up studying for a fuck ton of Advanced Placement exams on your own. You didn’t do it for college admissions (hard to believe, I know), but rather out of genuine interest in various subjects and a desire to learn about the world. By the time you’re reading this in the present, most of what you learned will be long gone, but it contributed to who you are as a person, so that’s irrelevant.

Aside from that, your main other activity is choir and composing choral music. You have a lot of tension with the choir program at your school---it’s an amazing program, but it’s mostly show choir–focused, which means dancing, which you are not good at in the slightest. Still, you don’t let that get you down; you do it for the love of the music. You pick up a love of aviation and travel from your father, who by this point has moved to China—but more on that later.

Eventually, after surviving a global pandemic (which had a surprisingly minimal impact on your life), your hard work pays off, and you end up admitted to the University of Chicago as a President’s Scholar. There’s a part of you that questions this decision when you commit, but their marketing and keen interest in you supersede that. Your first quarter there is a blast, but more fun than studying, but you write that off as your first taste of real freedom. You make friends, despite being socially awkward, most of which will disappear.
