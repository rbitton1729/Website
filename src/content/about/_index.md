# Who is Raphael?

A fair question. I’m still figuring that out myself. Buckle up, because you’re going to pretend you’re me while I narrate. If that’s not your jam, that’s okay; I’m just trying something and running with it. You (may or may not) have free will, so feel free to click away—but I promise this is a great way to get to know me.

Saturday, April 12th, 2003. Long Beach, California. It’s a cool, rainy day with a high dew point (maybe—I’m just making that up). A few minutes after noon, you spawn into the world. Excited and curious, you first meet your mom and dad, who will love and support you for the next two and a half decades. Your parents are Israeli by birth, naturalized in Canada, and your mother in the U.S. Your mom is a clinical neuropsychologist (we can call her Dr. Mom), and your dad is an “inventor,” though a lawyer by training. At the age of three, your sister—later to become your brother—is born. You don’t get along that well, but that’s okay; what siblings don't?

Okay, this is starting to read like an edgy college admissions paper—but I promise mine were much drier and less interesting than this. Anyway, skip forward a few years, and you’re in high school. You don’t have much of a personality right now, and you’re looking for a way to define yourself, so you end up studying for a fuck ton of Advanced Placement exams on your own. You didn’t do it for college admissions (hard to believe, I know), but rather out of genuine interest in various subjects and a desire to learn about the world. By the time you’re reading this in the present, most of what you learned will be long gone, but it contributed to who you are as a person, so that’s irrelevant.

Aside from that, your main other activity is choir and composing choral music. You have a lot of tension with the choir program at your school—it’s an amazing program, but it’s mostly show choir–focused, which means dancing, which you are not good at in the slightest. Still, you don’t let that get you down; you do it for the love of the music. You pick up a love of aviation and travel from your father, who by this point has moved to China—but more on that later.

Eventually, after surviving a global pandemic (which had a surprisingly minimal impact on your life), your hard work pays off, and you end up admitted to the University of Chicago as a President’s Scholar. There’s a part of you that questions this decision when you commit, but their marketing and keen interest in you supersede that. Your first quarter there is a blast—more fun than studying—but you write that off as your first taste of real freedom. You make friends, despite being socially awkward, most of whom will eventually drift away.

Around this time, another one of your favorite hobbies appears: flight simulation. You build a fully fledged simulator with a real yoke and thrust column and take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator, practicing ATC interactions and ground operations. For a while, things feel steady—you have new passions, a new environment, a sense of direction. But eventually, the novelty fades. The questions you’ve been avoiding start to catch up with you, and slowly, you slip into a darker stretch of life.

This is the part that isn’t all sparkles and rainbows. I’ll be honest—you struggle. You feel lost for a while, uncertain of identity and direction. Like many people, you go through a rough patch, taking time off school and learning some hard lessons about unhealthy coping mechanisms—travel, distraction, and yes, too much alcohol. But you come out on the other side feeling stronger than ever and having truly lived. In the span of one year—2023—you visit 24 countries across all six inhabited continents, more than most people ever will. You get to experience a multitude of cultures and expressions of life, love, and happiness. You wouldn’t trade that experience for the world.

At this point, you’ve given up on composition, despite a few heartfelt efforts to revive your love for it. After a while, you come back to school and discover your next big thing: Linux. Linux can quite possibly be described as the single greatest thing to happen to you. It fills the void you’d had in your life and gives you something to manically obsess about at 4 a.m. Something about orchestrating systems tickles your fancy in a way nothing else ever has. You ditch your iPhone, MacBook, and Windows desktop—all for Linux—and you have absolutely no regrets. You decide you want to spend the rest of your life working with these systems, dedicating all your spare time to them: setting up fast Docker Compose stacks, a website, a flight log, and a growing constellation of self-hosted services distributed across servers around the country.

And now you’re here. About to graduate and still have no idea what’s next. Go back home? Work for an airline? Try your luck as a system administrator? You don’t know yet — and that’s the point. Life rarely gives you the full configuration upfront. The only way forward is to test, deploy, and iterate.
